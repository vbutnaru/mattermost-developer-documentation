      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been more than a year and a half since we started using Cypress for our automated functional testing and it has been worth the investment. It has now become an essential part of our process to automate regression testing to ship new releases faster, with increased quality.
Itâ€™s fun and easy to get started with Cypress but as we added more scripts with the varying requirements, we faced several setbacks and hurdles, such as flaky tests, which slow down our efforts in automating test cases.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Your tests are failing.&amp;rdquo;
 This comment on a pull request is crushing. After all the effort you&amp;rsquo;ve spent writing your code, adding new unit tests, and rebasing your changes to make each commit almost a work of art: how could your tests possibly be failing?
Begrudgingly, you sign into your CI server only to realize the failing tests have nothing to do with your code. You think, &amp;ldquo;Hmm, maybe the code is more coupled than I expected.</description>
